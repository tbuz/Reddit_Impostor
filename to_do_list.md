# To Do List

## 1. Preparation & Research

- ~~Research: Which subreddits are interesting as text sources? (differences regarding length, fictional/non-fictional / facts)~~
  - ~~r/todayilearned/~~
  - ~~r/Showerthoughts/~~
  - ~~r/Jokes/~~
  - ~~r/LifeProTips/~~
  - ~~r/AskReddit/~~
  - ~~r/AskScience/~~
  - ~~r/stories/~~
  - ~~r/news, r/worldnews, r/politics~~
  - ~~=> Can you compare these in a table? What are important criteria to differentiate them?~~
- ~~Research: What are Word Embeddings? (Bag of Words, CountVectorizer, Word2Vec)~~
- ~~Research: Which language models are relevant / interesting?~~
  - ~~Markov Chain~~
  - ~~RNN/LSTM~~
  - ~~GPT-(2/3/neo)~~
  - ~~BERT / Transformers~~
  - ~~T5~~
  - ~~XLNet~~
- Research: Related research on social media bots, text style transfer, Reddit communities, ...
  - Use sources like: Google Scholar, Towardsdatascience, etc.
- Research & brainstorm: How to evaluate the success of a generated post?
  - How do other researchers measure similar tasks?
  - Kind of a "Turing Test" - Survey with 10 real and 10 fake posts
  - Post best posts on subreddit
  - ...

## 2. Dataset Acquisition & Exploration

- Collecting a sufficiently large dataset from selected subreddits
- ~~Look at Reddit API, Pushshift API~~
- ~~Pushshift API => Build a script to access the API~~
- ~~Compare different subreddits (avg word length, how much facts vs. story?, links or selftext, etc) => create table~~
- ...

## 3. Model Exploration / Training / Fine-Tuning & Testing

- Implement pre-trained models
- How to fine-tune a Language Model like BERT?
- ...

## 4. Evaluation

- How to evaluate the model?
- ...

## 5. Additional ideas
